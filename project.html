        <h2>Red Tides</h2>
      <p>
        Red tide is a hazardous natural phenomenon that involves harmful algal blooms (HABs) that change the color of the sea to a reddish-brown hue. These blooms produce toxins that have harmful effects on fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds. Furthermore, the decaying process of large masses of algae can reduce the oxygen levels in the water, causing marine animals to either flee the contaminated area or die due to the lack of oxygen entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        HABs also have a detrimental effect on humans, namely respiratory ailments and allergic reactions. This is primarily due to the toxic aerosols produced by the HABs being blown to the shore by the wind. Moreover, ingestion of the contaminated fish can also cause Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) and Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Philippines being an archipelagic country, the nation's borders are surrounded by bodies of water. Due to pollution and eutrophication, the shores of the country are a hotspot for the growth of HABs. Unicellular organisms such as Pyrodinium bahamense var compressum and Gymnodinium catenatum can be found in the Philippines, which cause PSP and NSP respectively.
      </p>
      <h3>Action</h3>
      <p>
        In response to this, the researchers have created a device that intends to detect various indicators of red tide in a body of water. The primary indicators that were measured include the temperature of the water, the total dissolved solids (TDS) and dissolved oxygen, and the presence of chlorophyll. The device makes use of a temperature sensor, a TDS sensor, as well as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to measure these indicators respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In correlation with the device, the researchers created this site to help easily monitor the live readings from the sensors across a certain time frame.
